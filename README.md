Algorithm for Gameplay Recognition 

This Repo will hopefully parse through a gametape, keeping only the gameplay sections. This will shorten the amount of time coaches and staff have to parse through video to make it watchable during scouting/training sessions.

The engine will be built off OpenCV-Python
First attempt will be with Volleyball
